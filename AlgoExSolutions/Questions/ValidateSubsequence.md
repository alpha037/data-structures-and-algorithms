## Validate Subsequence

#### Problem Statement

Given two non-empty arrays of integers, write a function that determines whether the second array
is a subsequence of the first one. A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent
in the array but that are in the same order as they appear in the array. For instance, the numbers `[1, 3, 4]`
form a subsequence of the array `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, , and so do the numbers `[2, 4]`. Note that a single number in an array and the array itself are both valid subsequences of the array.

`Sample Input: array = [5, 1, 22, 25, 6, -1, 8, 10], sequence = [1, 6, -1, 10]`
`Sample Output: true`
